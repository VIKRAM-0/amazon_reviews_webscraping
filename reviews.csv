Aashik Francis,Confused? Read on! One stop review for your flagship purchase.,"I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I’ve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive.
If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.

Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021), apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra. If you read a few reviews you’ll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues and 9pro cameras didn’t live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.

Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:

1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)
2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag
3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality
4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand
5. The haptics are spot on

What’s Missing: (Minor misses though)
1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you’ll get used to it.
2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change
3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensor

Wait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:
It took a while for 12’s prices to fall. If you’re willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.

64GB or 128GB:
The difference is around ₹6000. 64GB if you don’t play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128😊

Battery:
I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to it’s competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.

Android Flagship Option:
The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.

Hope this review helped :)

Update:

13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That’s it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.

iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12’s launch price(86k). If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k). However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.

Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022.",Yes,Black,128GB,iPhone 12
Placeholder,Excellent product; please purchase if your data is crucial.,"The iPhone 12 is the latest iteration of Apple's iconic smartphone series, and it continues to impress with its sleek design, powerful performance, and impressive camera capabilities. As a proud owner of the iPhone 12, I'd like to share my experiences and thoughts in this review.

Design and Build Quality (5/5):
Apple's design philosophy shines through in the iPhone 12. The flat-edged, aerospace-grade aluminum frame feels premium and comfortable to hold. The Ceramic Shield front cover offers extra durability, making me feel more confident in everyday use. The device is available in a variety of stunning colors, and the Super Retina XDR OLED display is simply brilliant, providing vibrant colors and deep blacks.

Performance (5/5):
Equipped with Apple's A14 Bionic chip, the iPhone 12 delivers top-notch performance. It handles multitasking, gaming, and demanding apps with ease. The device feels incredibly responsive, and I've never experienced any lag or slowdown, even with resource-intensive tasks.

Camera (4.5/5):
The iPhone 12 features a dual-camera system with a 12 MP wide and ultra-wide lens. The Night mode and Deep Fusion technology excel in low-light conditions, and the Smart HDR 3 makes every shot look stunning. However, compared to its more expensive sibling, the iPhone 12 Pro, it lacks a telephoto lens. Nonetheless, for the average user, the camera quality is more than satisfactory.

iOS 15 (5/5):
The iPhone 12 runs on iOS 15, which is Apple's latest and most feature-rich operating system. It's intuitive, secure, and keeps your device up-to-date. The App Library and widgets have been great additions, enhancing the user experience. Privacy features like App Tracking Transparency are commendable.

Battery Life (4/5):
While the iPhone 12's battery life is decent, it may not be the best among its competitors. It comfortably gets me through a full day of moderate use, but power users might need a top-up in the evening. However, the MagSafe wireless charging and support for fast charging (adapter sold separately) make it convenient to juice up quickly.

5G Connectivity (4.5/5):
With 5G support, the iPhone 12 is future-proofed for faster data speeds and improved connectivity. While 5G coverage may vary by region, it's an added bonus for those planning to keep their device for a few years.

Conclusion:
The iPhone 12 strikes an excellent balance between style and substance. It's a device that caters to the needs of a broad user base, offering impressive performance, a stunning display, and a camera that captures beautiful moments. iOS 15 brings a plethora of features to the table, and the device's design is nothing short of elegant. While battery life and the absence of a telephoto lens might deter some, for most users, the iPhone 12 is a fantastic choice, providing a premium Apple experience without the premium price tag.",Yes,Black,128GB,iPhone 12
Abhishek,An overall good premium experience,"SUMMERY: As a first time iPhone user, I would say one should definitely buy iPhone ONLY for premium built & premium hardware (will talk later) while the whole iOS experience is pretty overrated. iPhones isn't any exceptionally fast with normal apps like YouTube, Insta etc, Android phones are equally snappy with them in 2022.

PROS:
1. Impressive hardware, the heptics, the autobrightness & otherwise highly ignored things in Android are way too perfectly executed in iPhone and it DOES make a big difference in user experience!!
2. The screen is AMAZING.. it doesn't have 90 or 120 hz refresh rate but it FEELS better than my Nord with 90 hz!!
3. A14 bionic promises years of performance ahead.
4. Battery life is somewhere in between good & great.
5.
6. The dimensions of phone, it's smaller than usual android phones and feels much more handy along with less weight.
7. Overall build quality is great.
8. Best audio output out there.
9. Long term support.

CONS:
1. SLOW CHARGING. 20 W only, you'll be jealous of 1/3rd price phones with 60 W charging. Yes that much high charging will effect health of battery but 20 W is way way too less, if Apple is such a legendary company they should have created a battery that can withstand decently fast charging while instead they just use slow charging to keep their battery's health.
2. Overy exhagerated software experience, reality is that Android is more user friendly with better gesture & commonsense options & settings & steps to do simple things. iOS looks pretty yes but UX engineers at Apple have really done a crappy job.. there's still no notification grouping in correct manner (its executed poorly), no proper homescreen customisation & just so so so many ""commonsense"" things are missing from iOS I can rant all day about it. Everything you can do in Android with a single click or swipe takes 2 swipes and then a click to do in iOS its SOOOOO ANNOYING. Like you want to clear a notification? Swipe and then click on clear. You want to open a notification? Swipe FIRST and then click open.. like wth????????
3. DON'T believe Apple fanboys who scream about speed, Android phones are equally snappy in performance today. There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.
4. FaceID is nice but an in-fingerprint reader seems the best ID to me atleast, that's missing.
5. Ridiculously expensive accessories
6. Battery life is above good but not great.

In the end I would say iPhone, overall, does provide a better experience (mostly cuz of hardware only) but it's expensive. Do know that you're NOT buying a value-for-money phone at all, so buy it only if you can afford it without much difficulty.",Yes,,,
Manab Jyoti,Perfect product,"It's my second iPhone ever and I bought it with my earned money through part time jobs in college
I am a tech freak so you can trust my views -
- A14 Bionic is the fastest, most efficient and reliable processor till date
- The camera focuses so quickly that you can take
DSLR quality photos.
- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina DR display is so crisp and everything feels real.
- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume and gives awesome vibe while listening to music
- iOS has no bugs at all
- 20W charging is lit
- The Face ID feels like having no lock for yourself, there's no issue while using Face ID even in the dark because it uses infrared rays to scan the face
Drawbacks -
- Battery could be better",Yes,Green,128GB,iPhone 12
mahesh krishnan,First step into the ecosystem!,"I have been a smartphone user since 2015, used both windows and android, finally into iOS too. Bought it on Sep 26, 2022.
Btw, on the left side on the body, near the screen, the paint had been chipped off (microscopic level). Had complained to the Amazon customer service, but of no avail. 6 months later...........

1. The Externals:
Build Quality: Apart from the earlier niggle, a well put together phone. The familiar glass sandwich design. It is pretty light to hold and because of the squared design, feels really comfortable to hold. I'm not a fan of big phones, so this size is a perfect sweet spot. The buttons also feel really tactile, no wobbles whatsoever. The alert slider is really a blessing! a real convenient thing to have. I guess every manufacturer apart from Oneplus has to implement this. And then, the IP68. I haven't got a chance to take underwater photos, so yeah, It's a safe thing!

Screen: It is a beautiful display to watch on. Supports HDR and Dolby vision as well. Inky blacks and punchy colors: a treat for movie lovers!. ( Btw, I dont like to watch movies on phones)

Speakers: Dual front firing speakers. Loud, clear. No distortion even at high volumes. Doesn't have much of a bass but a really enjoyable one. Calls are crystal clear if there isn't any signal interference.

Cameras: It takes good quality photos with the rear as well as front cameras. In daylight, the photos look rich and crisp, details are really spot on, the colors look really natural, skin tones produced are natural. Night time photos too look really good. Night mode does make a difference. Considering it's a flagship from 2020, these things are really expected and it does deliver. I really don't have anything to comment about the video, It's splendid!.... just that.

2. The Internals.

Battery life: Still at 100% health(not a real thing to worry about, but just saying). On iOS 15, it used to be stellar, I usually get about 5.30 hrs at 50% battery and still there'll be about another 50% to spare. But on iOS 16, I only get about half the battery I used to get on iOS 15. (About 5-6 hours at 100% usage). I really hope this would change in the future with the upcoming updates, but at present, I'm not happy about it.
iOS & Performance : The A14 bionic is a beast. Apps open up in a jiffy. Not much of a gamer, but the games do play without a hint of lag. iOS is a fresh experience for me. But then there are many ""must have"" things that I miss here that I used in Android, like call recording(it's a must have feature, you never know when it'll be a life saver!), The performance and the overall fluidity of the system took a hit when I updated to iOS 16, but slowly, it's getting better over time with updates, (now on iOS 16.4) But, much more refinements to be done, a lot of bugs to be fixed!

Some general things : 5G is working fine. Getting good speeds just like the carriers advertised, signal reception is good. Heats up a bit (Culprit- iOS 16, haven't noticed on iOS 15)",Yes,Blue,128GB,iPhone 12
Sahil,Review,"I must say, it's an impressive smartphone that lives up to its reputation as a top-tier device. As of today's date, the iPhone 12 remains a fantastic choice, offering great value for its price.

Design:
The iPhone 12 boasts a refreshed design that sets it apart from other smartphones in the market. With its flat edges and straight lines reminiscent of the iconic iPhone 5, the device exudes elegance and sophistication. The Ceramic Shield display protection ensures added durability, providing peace of mind against accidental drops or scratches. The phone's slim and lightweight build, along with its ergonomic design, makes it a pleasure to hold and use. Apple's attention to detail and build quality shine through, making it one of the best-looking smartphones available.

Performance:
The iPhone 12 delivers solid and nippy performance, whether browsing the web, playing games, or running multiple applications simultaneously. With Apple's powerful A14 Bionic chip, the device handles tasks with ease and ensures smooth performance across various applications and functions.

Camera:
The camera performance on the iPhone 12 is reliable and impressive. The point-and-shoot capabilities, along with HDR video support, allow for capturing stunning photos and videos in various lighting conditions. While it may not have all the features of the iPhone 12 Pro, the camera on the iPhone 12 still produces high-quality images that are sure to impress.

5G Support:
The iPhone 12 comes equipped with 5G support, ensuring faster download and upload speeds and improved connectivity. This feature future-proofs the device, allowing users to take advantage of the latest advancements in mobile networks.

Affordability:

In the UK, it is now available at £649, and in the US, it is even more budget-friendly at $599. For the features and performance it offers, the iPhone 12 is an excellent investment.

Overall, the Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) - Blue is a fantastic smartphone that delivers on all fronts – from its stunning design and reliable camera performance to its powerful internals and 5G support. If you are looking for a premium smartphone that offers a seamless user experience and excellent value for money, the iPhone 12 is undoubtedly worth considering.",Yes,,,
Ak.Bidyananda Singh,iPhones,Good product,Yes,,,
Ranit Kumar Dholey,Long Term Review: Excellent All Rounder Device,"This is going to be a long review, sit back, relax and have a read.
I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.
Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.

I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.
And boy was I surprised . Let’s take up the review in sections.
1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .

2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it’s only for social media and you are not printing really big.

3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it’s average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.

4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.

5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.

Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended.",Yes,Blue,128GB,iPhone 12

Gaurav solanki,"BEST PRODUCT, VALUE FOR MONEY","A very good Product, very Good Platform, very good packaging, very good delivery,",Yes,,,
Prasanna Bhalerao,iPhone is the standard against which all smartphones are compared,"I purchased this phone for my wife. Last year I purchased iPhone X for my son who is currently in the UK. I own an iPad and iMac 27"". I am not going to buy an iPhone for myself - at least not yet. One of the main things that I don't like about Android phones is the crap (bloatware) that each maker puts in. Moto and Google Pixel come with pure stock Android. So those can be left out. So I wanted a good phone for my wife so that she could FaceTime with my son in the UK anytime.

What is there to say? So many have written about it. Since everyone writes all the positives, I will write some negatives. While there aren't too many, no product can be perfect:

1. Brings in all the junk from the old phone. If one is switching from Android to iPhone, the ""Move to iOS"" app on Android can help. However be sure to clean up your Android phone first else all junk (especially ""Good Morning"", ""Good day"" picture crap from WhatsApp photos). Be sure to clean the SMS inbox also, especially all those blocked and spam messages which may be hidden from the main view and we never know that exist.
2. WhatsApp cannot be synced. Yes, there are 3rd party apps but they are full of ad-crap and I can't trust them for security.
3. Difficulty in validating iMessage and FaceTime. I could not activate iMessage and FaceTime with my mobile number. I simply could not figure this out. This is the case with my Vodaphone SIM/Number in India. Only when I added my email to my Apple ID, the two apps started working. Even now, the mobile number is not verified.
4. I wish Apple provides dual SIM. Now dual SIM is almost a necessity. But as my wife does not use two SIMs, for her, it is fine.
5. Apple is providing USB-C to lightning cable. They should supply USB-A to lightning cable instead. 99% of the chargers have a USB-A output. I had to purchase a USB-A to USB-C mini adapter (₹180) for this, or someone may have to buy a cable of the type (good cables from Apple, Belkin, Anker cost ₹1100 and above). By far, this is my biggest grouse.
6. This is not the latest iPhone. The iPhone 13 was ₹73,000 and did not seem VFM. Even at ₹56,000 (₹55,900 to be exact), the iPhone12 may not be money best spent. This is one reason, why I haven't purchased an iPhone for myself all this while (I can afford to buy the latest one every year).",Yes,,,
RakhuNathan,Not Really worth the money,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.

Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)

Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items. But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?

Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.

I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.

Placeholder,Beast🤩🤩🤩🤩,"Hello there,
I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-
Memory
Build quality
Camera
Processor
Display
Except battery there’s rumour going on that iPhone 12 battery is bad or worst, so i am here to clarify all your doubts,
iPhone battery will last easily a day but not more than that and here’s some condition that you should aware about
1. If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.
2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you’re on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.
Here’s some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know “How to save battery on iPhone 12” this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.
For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don’t have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.

Got original product Btw!!!!!",Yes,Black,128GB,iPhone 12
Piyush Kumar,Phone is great but iOS sucks,"First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.

Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.
It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-

iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.

let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-
1. Notifications
- You can't reply through notifications.
- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)
- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).
- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.

2. App library
- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.

3. whatsapp
- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.
- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.
- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)
- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.

The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.

I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.
I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing.",Yes,,,
Akshay kumar,I like 💖 Amazon product,"I like Amazon product,",Yes,,,
Good vegetable,How to decide between iPhone 11 and 12,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ₹ 84900. After credit card discount(₹6000), old phone exchange(₹3450) and reward points money(₹4530) inclusion, I bought it for ₹70920. There’s also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn’t let go of blue

1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it’d cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn’t seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.

2: DISPLAY: I’ve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.

3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.

How to choose between 64/128gb:
If you’re not really tight on budget, I’d suggest to go for 128gb variant. I’ve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage occupied about 60gb. So it’d make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.

CONS:
1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price
2. If you’re an android user, migration would be little time consuming

Update: I’ve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)",Yes,Blue,128GB,iPhone 12
Pradeepkumar,Camara quality is very nice,Mobile is speed,Yes,,,
rupinder,I miss my OnePlus 6,"Android v/s iOS

Pro Apple
1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.
And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud.

2. Battery
The battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.

3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.

4. Build Quality - SOLID.

5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.

6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.

Pro Android / Anti - iOS
1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.

2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.

3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.

4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.

5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.

6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.

7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.

I'll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they're way too deep in ios ecosystem now.",Yes,Blue,128GB,iPhone 12
Chetan Pamini,99.99% Perfect Smartphone !!,"Nicely packed !! Kudos to seller !!
I was very much confused between iphone 11 and this one as the price of iphone dropped ... But i am glad i chose this over iphone 11.
1.Display:
Main upgrade in iphone 12 is the oled display. Boy o boy the screen is amazing. I have user many android flagship's but this beats them all.
2.Battery:
Battery is amazing. I am getting 1.5 days of battery life with my usage.
PS: i dont play games.
3.IOS:
This is my 1st iphone and the experience with ios is great ... Very smooth animations ..even though its not 90hz screen but everything is buttery smooth.
4. Camera:
The pics from this phone is superb. FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA! You will not be dissapointed.
5 Build &Design :
This phone looks and feels very premium compared to other phones.Very comfotable to use.
6.Face Id:
Face id works very fast and accurate in low lighting conditions.
7.Updates:
Ios14 is good and we can expect another 4yrs of software updates thats huge !

Cons:
1.Priced very high but it may be because of high taxes and custom duty.
2.No charger and earpods in the box.
3.Notifications are a mess ...android is better in managing new notifications.

Overall a great Phone IF You are OK with the Price !!!",Yes,Green,128GB,iPhone 12
Asutosh padhy,Absolutely loved the phone but price could have been bit cheaper,"I phone i must say having great optimization of software with hardware, more quality apps are available when compared to google, receiving a file is the only major pain i felt till now,
Battery backup is really good 2800 mAh in apple is almost like 5000mAh in android am not kidding, i have rog phone 3 it is 6000 mAh but at the end of the day the i phone has almost same % left, may be it's due to the less hz display.
Despite of having 60Hz display it feels good
And what can i say the speakers are loud and clear compared with rog 3.
45k should have been the right price for 64gb model but for 53k it's not a bad deal either, if you ask me spending 50k for an android is not worth since i phone has all hardware and software superiority.
No charger is a big let down by apple. And finally 64gb is good enough if you ask me as most of those having wifi connection can easily upgrade to i cloud paying just 75rs/Month and for the average 3 years of use the price will be still 2700rs in three year. For the 128gb i had to pay 8000rs more so still i am saving around 5300rs if i chose to use i cloud from the starting day.
No Finger print sensor , but it's ok the face id does it right but yes the finger print should be good. And for the notch it's ok. I phone 12 and 13 has virtually no difference so y to waste 20k more money buying the 13 just for the bit improvement of camera and brightness, hope you like my review 🙂",Yes,,,
Amazon Customer,Thanks Amazon,"Buy it on sale on a good price
Love it",Yes,,,

Sanjib M.,"READ before BUY ! ""Iphone 12! Worth buying or not?""","From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.

As per the limitations :

1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)
2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.
3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)
4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)
5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)

Advantages:

1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.
2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)
3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)
4. The design and in-hand feel.
5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.

Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)

On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.
But iPhone 12 in 2020? its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.
If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience.",Yes,,,
Mohit Pal,Best phone,Amazing photography. Fast charging.,Yes,Blue,128GB,iPhone 12
@nwesha,The best thing ever happened in my life..!!,"First let me tell u it's a real beauty and this my first phone which is a iPhone....I was really excited about it to come to me as fast as possible........and before that I used Android phones which was my mom's as I was a teenager ...So it's been 1 week It came...it's not a bid deal you know to go from Android to iPhone you know..In just one day I got accustomed to it.....let me tell you... that you can't download MP3 music in iPhone where In Android it's a easy peasy thing....which I knew after receiving iPhone.....which would be a real bother to music alcoholic people...in those count me too....and please go with 128 gb if you want to buy because from 128 gb, 17 gb have already used in iOS system....which would be a real problem to you if you guys buy 64 gb variant...The camera is is really good factor...my siri is lightly having problem..it's always like ""Something went wrong! Please try again ""..I know i would happen to solve this problem too : ) .......I bought iPhone as because it's beast in case of CAMERAS...and it went really good price in the Great Indian Festival Of Amazon.....
And Lastly but not least...
THANK YOU AMAZON FOR KEEPING MY REQUEST TO DELIVER THIS PRODUCT FASTER!!",Yes,,,
Lav,Great purchase!,"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.
As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.
Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.
When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.
I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.
INR 3000₹ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000₹ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000₹. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900₹ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.
Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure.",Yes,,,
Cyber Naskar,Worth the price,"I migrated to iOS after using Android for more than 8 years. I am a standard mobile user, I do not play games on my phone and neither do I keep browsing social media for ages. The only things that I use my phone are for calling, whatsapp, taking notes, some light photography and watching videos. The most heavily used activity on my phone is watching videos on youtube.

With all these activities being done, my weekly average screen on time is 2-3 hours. I am satisfied with the battery life. It has been around 3 months of usage and the battery capacity is still 100%. With heavy usage, the phone lasts 6 hours give or take a few minutes, and with medium usage this goes way higher.
The standby time is excellent on this device. I have had instances where I used my phone for a total of 2-3 hours but a single charge lasted more than 36 hours.

All in all, I can confidently say that I am very happy with the security features the phone offers and I am happy with my purchase.",Yes,Black,128GB,iPhone 12
B K Danta,This is a very good phone. The seller is reliable.,"iPhone 12 is a good product. If you are not obsessed with the ‘latest and the best’ type of phone, go for any apple phone on the list. I chose 12 because it is 5 G compliant. If you are a price watcher, this is perhaps the best time to buy this one. I bought my phone earlier this month, and the price has dropped by one thousand rupees since then! But I am happy with the phone. Apple phones are expensive, but once you use an iPhone, you may not wish to use any other phone. I have been using a 5S for ten years. Only recently I changed the battery. It still looks good and works fine. You may take a couple of days to get used to the new device. 128 prices have dropped, 64 prices have remained almost the same since early October. This seller is good. Initially I was a bit unsure about buying it online, but if you live in a small city even buying from an apple store is almost like online buying. Go for it. Too early to comment on battery life. For best results, keep your iPhone phone on low battery mode, except while charging.",Yes,Black,128GB,iPhone 12
Achintya Aviral,Just Wow....,"I have been using iPhone SE 2020 since last year which has been a great experience for me. Now that I bought IPhone 12 it is also a great phone with so many features. But the best thing I have experienced is the camera quality. It is way much better than any other phone at this rate. I bought this phone in Great Indian Sale and bought only for 47 K which is also been a benefit for me. It's build quality is good and it is light weighted, lighter than Iphone SE 2020. The processor is fast but the battery back up is not up to the mark. It goes from 100 to 20 in a day use and I am not using it much so the battery is not that good. I also have to buy the 20w charger and it is really charging fast. When you are holding the phone it will make you feel premium. The phone hasn't lag since one month use. It will regularly get updates which is great. Other than battery backup there is nothing you will regret about the phone. Overall an iphone is and iphone. At least you will look rich.",Yes,Blue,128GB,iPhone 12
Abhishek,A Nice product with lot of restrictions,"iP12 feels premium, sturdy, has nice camera and quick gps maps response.

I am a Google Pixel 2 user since 4.5 years so I will mention where I like/dislike this phone over pixel-2.

1- iP 12 Feels premium
2- Gps map response is awesome
3- so many restrictions in user interface and controls, pixel is way better
4- both have awesome camera quality
5- pixel is more handy to use
6- Pixel response is a lot better in low signal areas
7- bluetooth range is awesome in iP12
8- typing and keyboard experience is better in pixel
9- Noise cancellation is much better in my 4.5yrs old Pixel-2 compared to iP
10- Last but not least, pixel's day to day usage experience is a lot easy and smooth as compared to lot of restrictions and complicated response of iP12.

So if your usage is simple and you want to have feeling of premium product, go for iP.

My next phone will be Pixel again..",Yes,,,

Abhishek James,For first time iPhone Users,"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.
All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.
The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.

So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily.",Yes,Black,128GB,iPhone 12
s3r,Best selling phone in the world!!!,"No wonder Apple makes some of the best phones in the world. Iphone 12 deservedly is the highest selling phone.

I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.

The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.

The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what's to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.

The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.

Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.

Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase.",Yes,Black,128GB,iPhone 12

Suman Remaniche,The best Iphone in the budget.,"IPhone 12 is probably the best option to start or enter into the ios ecosystem.Here are the advantages of iphone 12:
1.The best camera phone,photos are amazing nad the video quality is even more better.
2.The performance is just top notch.No complaints at all.
3.The IOS is best at everything.No lags at all or almost.
4.The display is just amazing.It could feel a bit small, if you are shifting from an android,but the display quality is great.

Here are a few disadvantages:
1.The battery will last a whole day only if you are a moderate to light user.
2.The file transfer to an android device is a big hassle.

Conclusion: It is a very good device if you don't play too much games or use camera all day, as the battery will not last.
For me it is the best.",Yes,,,
Manjula,Honest review after 30-40 Days,"Switched to IOS for the first time, was really very excited to get the iphone 12.
Display is stunning but might feel small if ur switching from a 6.5inch android
Speakers are amazing they are loud, clear and have dolby effects.
Build quality is superb which is expected from apple
Face id might sound a bit concerning but its well integrated and works flawlessly.
Camera is simply superb for a 2020 phone the video quality is unmatched.
Haptics are flagship level.

Cons-
battery isnt that good and needs to be charged once a day at the least sometimes even 2 times.
no charger in box had to purchase 20w charger for 1.8k
provided cable doesnt feel very sturdy
IOS 16 is filled with bugs and degraded battery life compared to ios 15( at the time of review)
The network reception isnt that great (cellular) wifi is great",Yes,,,
